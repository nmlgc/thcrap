Touhou Community Reliant Automatic Patcher
------------------------------------------

### Description ###

Basically, this is an almost-generic, easily expandable and customizable framework to patch Windows applications in memory, specifically tailored towards the translation of Japanese games.

It is mainly developed to facilitate self-updating, multilingual translation of the [Touhou Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project) games on [Touhou Patch Center](http://thpatch.net/), but can theoretically be used for just about any other patch for these games, without going through that site.

#### Main features of the base engine #####

* Easy **DLL injection** of the main engine and plug-ins into the target process.

* **Full propagation to child processes**. This allows the usage of other third-party patches which also use DLL injection, together with thcrap. (Yes, this was developed mainly for vpatch.)

* Uses **JSON for all patch configuration data**, making the patches themselves open-source by design. By recursively merging JSON objects, this gives us...

* **Patch stacking** - apply any number of patches at the same time, sorted by a priority list. Supports wildcard-based blacklisting of files in certain patches through the run configuration.

* Automatically adds **transparent Unicode filename support** via Win32 API wrappers to target processes using the Win32 ANSI functions, without the need for programs like [AppLocale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppLocale).

* Patches can support **multiple builds and versions** of a single program, identified by a combination of SHA-256 hashes and .EXE file sizes.

* **Binary hacks** for arbitrary in-memory modifications of the original program (mostly used for custom assembly).

* **Breakpoints** to call custom DLL functions at any instruction of the original code. These functions can read and modify the current CPU register state.

 * **File breakpoints** to replace data files in memory with replacements from patches.

* Wildcard-based **file format patching hooks** called on file replacements - can apply patches to data files according to a (stackable!) JSON description.

* ... and all that without any significant impact on performance. â˜º

### Modules included ###

* `win32_utf8`: A UTF-8 wrapper library around the Win32 API calls we require. This is a stand-alone project and can (and should) be freely used in other applications, too.
* `thcrap`: The main patch engine.
* `thcrap_loader`: A command-line loader to call the injection functions of `thcrap` on a newly created process.
* `thcrap_configure`: A rather cheap command-line patch configuration utility. Will eventually be replaced with a GUI tool.
* `thcrap_tsa`: A thcrap plug-in containing patch hooks for games using the STG engine by Team Shanghai Alice.
* `thcrap_update`: A thcrap plug-in containing updating functionality for patches.

### Building ###

As of now, all subprojects only include a Visual C++ 2010 project file for building. SP1 is recommended, if only for correct version identification in Explorer. Build configurations for different systems are always welcome.

#### Dependencies ####

* [Jansson](http://www.digip.org/jansson/) is required for every module apart from `win32_utf8`. Compile it from the [latest source](https://github.com/akheron/jansson), then add its include and library directories to every project.

* [libpng](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html) **(>= 1.6.0)** is required by `thcrap_tsa` for image patching.

* [zlib](http://zlib.net/) is required by `thcrap_update` for CRC32 verification. It's required by `libpng` anyway, though.

The scripts in the `scripts` directory are written in [Python 3](http://python.org/). Some of them require further third-party libraries:

* [PyCrypto](https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/) is required by `release_sign.py`.

### Contributing ###

This project is actively developed, and contributions are always welcome.

We track the development status of future features on the GitHub Issues page of this repository. Feel free to chip in, discuss implementation details and contribute code - we would *really* appreciate being able to share the workload between a number of developers.

If, for whatever reason, you don't want to go through GitHub, you can also contact Nmlgc by mail under nmlgc@thpatch.net.

### Plug-in development ###

At this stage, we recommend that you regularly send us pull requests for whatever custom plug-ins you develop around the base engine. The API of the base engine is far from finalized and may be subject to change. In case we *do* end up changing something, these changes can then directly be reflected in your project.
